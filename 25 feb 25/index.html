                    <p style="text-indent: 50px;"> Water is uniquely vulnerable to pollution. Known as a “universal solvent,” water is able to dissolve more substances than any other liquid on earth. It’s the reason we have Kool-Aid and brilliant blue waterfalls. It’s also why water
                        is so easily polluted. Toxic substances from farms, towns, and factories readily dissolve into and mix with it, causing water pollution</p>
                    <p style="letter-spacing: 5px;">When contamination originates from a single source, it’s called point source pollution. Examples include wastewater (also called effluent) discharged legally or illegally by a manufacturer, oil refinery, or wastewater treatment facility,
                        as well as contamination from leaking septic systems, chemical and oil spills, and illegal dumping. The EPA regulates point source pollution by establishing limits on what can be discharged by a facility directly into a body of
                        water. While point source pollution originates from a specific place, it can affect miles of waterways and ocean.</p>

                    <p style="text-align: justify;">Water pollution occurs when harmful substances—often chemicals or microorganisms—contaminate a stream, river, lake, ocean, aquifer, or other body of water, degrading water quality and rendering it toxic to humans or the environment.
                        This widespread problem of water pollution is jeopardizing our health.</p>
                    <p style="text-decoration: underline red double;">Water pollution is any change, minor or major in the physical, chemical or biological properties of water that eventually leads to a detrimental consequence of any living organism. Drinking water, called Potable Water, is considered
                        safe enough for human and animal consumption.</p>
